      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently a student at CPCC (Central Piedmont Community College), where I am pursuing an Associate in Arts
        degree. I plan to transfer
        to UNCC (University of North Carolina at Charlotte) in the future. My passion for development began in middle
        school when my
        sister introduced me to coding through classes focused on HTML and CSS. Since then, I've developed my
        skills by practicing with
        resources like <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and <a
          href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a>.
      </p>

      <!-- My Goals section -->
      <h2>What Are My Goals?</h2>
      <p>I am driven by the goal of breaking into the tech industry and landing my first role as a junior developer or
        internship. My long-term
        ambition is to become a full-stack developer and eventually work at one of the top tech companies, often referred
        to as
        the <i>FAANG</i> giants. Above all, I aim to add value wherever I work by being reliable, adaptable, and committed
        to continuous
        learning.
      </p>

      <!-- Hobbies and personal interests -->
      <h2>What Do I Do Outside of Code?</h2>
      <p>In addition to coding, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me balanced. Fitness is a big part of my life; I
        regularly go to the gym
        to lift weights and stay in shape, with the bench press being one of my favorite exercises. Art is another
        creative outlet I enjoy. I’ve
        been drawing since I was young and aim to complete my first sketchbook. I also practice aquascaping, which is one
        of my most therapeutic
        hobbies. Watching my aquarium plants sway and observing my fish, shrimp, and snails interact in the tank offers a
        calming escape from
        everyday life. On a quiet Sunday evening, you’ll likely find me in front of my tanks, immersed in the peaceful
        atmosphere I've created.
      </p>

        <h3>Pixels & Ambitions</h3>
        <p>This is a clean and responsive personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. It's designed to showcase my 
          skills, background, and personal projects in a simple and visually appealing layout. It's my first step toward building 
          a strong online presence as a developer.</p>
